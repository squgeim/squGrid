# squGRID

This is a very very simple tool for sketch artists.

Most amature sketch artists start by sketcing a picture. To maintain proportion they
imagine a grid on the picture and make a grid in the paper and sketch it grid-by-grid.
It is a basic "divide and conquer" approach to sketching.

This tool allows you to drop any image in and it'll draw a grid over it. You can then
download the new image.
